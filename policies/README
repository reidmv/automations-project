# Policies

Configuration policies are specially namespaced Puppet classes defined at the
project level. Policies are located in the project's `policies/` directory.
They are namespaced with "policy::", and the name of the filename of the
specific policy. For example, `policies/baseline.pp` should contain a Puppet
class named "policy::baseline`.

    policies/
      Contains all the policies in the project.
    
      baseline.pp
        Policy classes are namespaced with "policy::" and the name of the defining
        file. For example, this class is named "policy::baseline".
    
      windows/
        You can group policy classes in subdirectories of the policies directory.
        The name of the subdirectories add namespace elements to the policy class
        names.
    
        legal_noticies.pp
          This class is named "policy::windows::legal_notices"
